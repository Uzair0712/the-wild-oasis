<h1>The Wild Oasis:</h1>
<p>
Welcome to The Wild Oasis, an exquisite real-world application designed to streamline the management of cabin bookings. Functioning much like a hotel management system, this application encompasses features such as user check-in, check-out, payment confirmation, and the option to include breakfast. Additionally, it offers internal functions like user login, account creation, and settings updates.
</p>
<p>
This is a full-stack application developed with React and its supporting libraries for the front end, while leveraging the Supabase API as the back end and database solution. The project incorporates Styled Components for styling, React Query for global state management, and utilizes popular tools such as React Router and React Hot Toast.

Building this remarkable application has been a valuable learning experience in JavaScript and React. Throughout the development process, I delved into real-world coding techniques, gaining insights into the intricacies of crafting production-grade applications. The journey, fueled by the React course I am currently undertaking, was both educational and enjoyable.

Excitingly, this project is not static; future plans include the addition of more functionalities to enhance the application's utility and user experience. Stay tuned for further updates!
